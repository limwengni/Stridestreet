      <br>
      <h4 class="fw-bold">Currency-neutral sales grow 1% </h4>
      <p>In 2022, currency-neutral revenues grew 1%, reflecting increases in all market segments except Greater China.
        From a channel perspective, adidas’ top-line development was supported by growth in both wholesale (+1%) and the
        company’s own direct-to-consumer (DTC) business (+2%). Within DTC, own retail revenues were flat compared to the
        prior year level. E-commerce revenues increased 4% during the year driven by double-digit growth in North
        America and Latin America. From a category perspective, currency-neutral revenues in Performance grew at a
        strong double-digit rate, while Lifestyle revenues declined. In euro terms, the company’s revenues increased 6%
        in 2022 to € 22,511 million (2021: € 21,234 million).</p>
      <br>
      <h4 class="fw-bold">Revenue growth in all market segments except Greater China</h4>
      <p>From a market perspective, currency-neutral sales grew at a double-digit rate in Latin America (+44%) and North
        America (+12%). Revenues in EMEA were up 9% amid the significant adverse impact from the wind-down of the
        company’s business in Russia. Sales in Asia-Pacific grew 4% in 2022. In Greater China, revenues declined 36%
        compared to the prior year level due to the challenging market environment, company-specific challenges as well
        as significant inventory takebacks.</p>
        <br>

      <h4 class="fw-bold">Gross margin at 47.3% </h4>
      <p>The company’s gross margin decreased 3.4 percentage points to 47.3% in 2022 (2021: 50.7%). Broad-based price
        increases were more than offset by the strong increase in supply chain costs, reflecting increased product costs
        and freight expenses. In addition, higher discounts, particularly in the second half of the year, a less
        favorable market, category, and channel mix as well as negative currency developments weighed on the gross
        margin development in 2022. One-off costs in the amount of € 59 million reflecting the company’s decision to
        wind down its business in Russia as well as higher provisions for customs-related risks also had an adverse
        impact on gross margin.</p>
        <br>

      <h4 class="fw-bold">Operating margin decreases to 3.0% </h4>
      <p>Other operating expenses increased 15% to € 10,260 million in 2022 (2021: € 8,892 million). As a percentage of
        sales, other operating expenses were up 3.7 percentage points to 45.6% (2021: 41.9%). Marketing and
        point-of-sale expenses increased 8% to € 2,763 million (2021: € 2,547 million) as the company continued to
        invest into campaigns, such as ‘Run for the Oceans,’ ‘Stanniversary,’ and the Basketball campaign ‘Remember the
        Why.’ Further campaigns were launched around major sports events such as the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, the
        UEFA Women’s Euro 2022, and the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. In addition, adidas invested into the launch of new
        products such as the X Speedportal football boot, the record-winning Adizero Adios Pro 3 running shoe, the
        adidas x Gucci collection, and the federation kits for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. Further enhancing the
        consumer experience across both its digital and physical platforms was another important part of adidas’
        marketing spend in 2022. As a percentage of sales, marketing and point-of-sale expenses increased 0.3 percentage
        points to 12.3% (2021: 12.0%). Operating overhead expenses increased 18% to € 7,498 million (2021: € 6,345
        million), including € 253 million of one-off costs related to the company’s decision to wind down its business
        in Russia, a settled legal dispute, as well as restructuring costs as part of the company’s business improvement
        program. As a percentage of sales, operating overhead expenses increased 3.4 percentage points to 33.3% (2021:
        29.9%). As a result of the gross margin decrease, the increase in other operating expenses as a percentage of
        sales as well as the one-off costs of € 312 million, the company’s operating profit decreased 66% to € 669
        million in 2022 (2021: € 1,986 million). Consequently, the operating margin decreased 6.4 percentage points to
        3.0% compared to the prior year level of 9.4%. </p>

      <h3 class="text-center text-pink fw-bold">FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN Q4 2022</h3>
      <br>
      <h4 class="fw-bold">Sales in the fourth quarter impacted by the decision to terminate the Yeezy partnership</h4>
      <p>Currency-neutral revenues in the fourth quarter declined 1%. This development reflects the negative impact of
        around € 600 million related to the company’s decision to terminate the Yeezy partnership at the end of October.
        In addition, a strong revenue decline in Greater China (-50%) due to the challenging market environment,
        company-specific challenges as well as significant inventory takebacks weighed on the company’s top-line
        development in the quarter. At the same time, revenues in Latin America (+47%), Asia-Pacific (+16%), and EMEA
        (+12%) grew at double-digit rates. Currency-neutral sales increased 6% in North America amid the discontinuation
        of the Yeezy partnership which had a particularly strong impact in this market. From a channel perspective, the
        company’s top-line development was driven by wholesale where currency-neutral revenues increased 4%. Revenues in
        the company’s own DTC channel declined 1%. While e-commerce revenues decreased 4% during the quarter, sales in
        adidas own retail stores increased 1%. In euro terms, total adidas revenues increased 1% versus the prior year
        to € 5,205 million (2021: € 5,137 million).</p>
        <br>

      <h3 class="text-center text-pink fw-bold">OUTLOOK FOR 2023</h3>
      <br>
      <h4 class="fw-bold">Underlying operating profit expected to be around break-even level</h4>
      <p>In 2023, adidas expects currency-neutral revenues to decline at a high-single-digit rate as macroeconomic
        challenges and geopolitical tensions persist. Elevated recession risks in Europe and North America as well as
        uncertainty around the recovery in Greater China continue to exist. The company’s revenue development will also
        be impacted by the initiatives to significantly reduce high inventory levels. In addition, while the company
        continues to review future options for the utilization of its Yeezy inventory, the guidance already reflects the
        revenue loss of around € 1.2 billion from potentially not selling the existing stock. Accounting for the
        corresponding negative operating profit impact of around € 500 million, the company’s underlying operating
        profit is projected to be around the break-even level in 2023. </p>
